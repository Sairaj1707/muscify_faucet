# Muscify_faucet

## Overview

This project is a blockchain-based faucet distribution system designed to allow users to mine a specified amount of faucet. Once the mining limit is reached, a lock-in period is enforced for a set amount of time before the faucet resets. This system can be utilized by companies as a secure and efficient way to distribute their faucets to users.

## Features

- **Faucet Mining:** Users can mine a set amount of faucet using the platform.
- **Lock-in Period:** After mining the maximum allowed faucet, users will enter a lock-in period of `n` time during which they cannot mine additional faucet.
- **Auto-Reset:** Once the lock-in period ends, the faucet availability is reset, allowing users to mine again.
- **Blockchain Security:** Ensures secure and transparent transactions through blockchain technology.

## Use Case

This system is ideal for companies looking to distribute digital assets or tokens to users in a controlled and secure manner. By setting a mining limit and enforcing a lock-in period, companies can regulate the distribution flow of their assets and prevent abuse.

## How It Works

1. **User Registration:** Users register on the platform using their digital wallet.
2. **Faucet Mining:** Once registered, users can start mining faucet up to a predefined limit.
3. **Lock-in Period:** After reaching the mining limit, the user's account enters a lock-in period. During this time, no additional faucet can be mined.
4. **Auto-Reset:** At the end of the lock-in period, the user's faucet mining capability is reset, allowing them to mine again.
